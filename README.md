# Discrete-Gaussian-Curvature
>Mixed Area is to be added.

## Introduction
This is a method of discrete Gaussian Curvature operator.

## Quick start
1. Visit the folder "exp".
2. Run the file "Demo.m"

>The data sphere_v10242.mat or sphere_v4.mat can be chosen. The number next to v means the number of vertex parametrize of the sphere. That is, sphere_v4.mat is a tetrahedron.
